# Handwritten-Digit_Recognization
Handwritten Digit Recognition (implemented with Feedforward Fully Connected)
### Computational Intelligence Course 1st Project 

In this project a simple `neural network` is implemented in 2 different ways (`MNIST` Dataset is used for training and testing):
> 1. Without vectorization
> 2. With vectorization

At the end an Adversarial attack has taken place on images (shifting the images). SGD with momentum is implemented as well.



### Steps:
#### 1. Reading from dataset and testing it

<br>

#### 2. Calculate accuracy(feedforward)

<br>

#### 3. Backpropagation

<br>

#### 4. Vectorization and increase number of epoch

<br>

#### 5. Calculate accuracy in train test and test set
